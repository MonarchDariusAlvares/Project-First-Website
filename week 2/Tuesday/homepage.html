	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
	<p class="blueclass">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</p>
	<p>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type</p>
	<p class="blueclass">specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into</p>
	<p>electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in</p>
	<p class="blueclass">the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,</p>
	<p>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including</p>
	<p class="blueclass">versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
