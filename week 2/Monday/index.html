			<h1>Heading H1</h1>
			Dummy text
			<p class="fontRed"> <span>On </span>the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men 	</p>
				<p class="fontBlue"> <span>who</span> are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, </p>
				<p class="fontRed"> <span>so</span> blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are </p>
				<p class="fontBlue"> <span>bound</span> to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through </p>
				<p class="fontRed"> <span>weakness</span> of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. </p>
				<p class="fontBlue"> <span>These</span> cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our </p>
				<h2 ><span>blue</span></h2>
				<p class="fontRed"> <span>power</span> of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what</p>
				<p class="fontBlue"> <span>we</span> like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain</p>
				<p class="fontRed"> <span>circumstances</span> and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will</p>
				<p class="fontBlue"> <span>frequently</span> occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise</p>
				<p class="fontRed"> <span>man</span> therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects </p>
				<p class="fontBlue"> <span>pleasures</span> to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
